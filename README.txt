SpriteCrop is a tool for interactively extracting sprite cropping metrics 
by selecting rectangular regions in a sprite map image. 

Requirements:
----------------
You'll need the following tools to be able to compile and run SpriteCrop:
* At least Java 6 JDK and JRE
* Adobe Ant



Building SpriteCrop.jar from the source code:
-------------------
Open a command terminal in the "development" directory and enter the command
"ant all"

This will create the SpriteCrop.jar in the "latest" directory and it will 
also create the API docs for SpriteCrop in the "docs" directory.


Frequently Asked Questions:
----------------

Q : Is it done yet? 

    No, but this is intended to be a short project. So it shouldn't take 
    long for it to be completed.
